/*
Advantages:

1. Code modularity: With dependency injection, you can separate different components of your code and their dependencies. This makes it easier to reuse and maintain code.
2. Testability: Dependency injection allows for easy mocking of dependencies, making it easier to test components in isolation.
3. Flexibility: Dependency injection makes it easy to change dependencies without changing the code that uses them. This can be helpful when you need to swap out a library or API for another one.
4. Encourages best practices: Dependency injection encourages the use of interfaces and abstractions, which can lead to better design and more maintainable code.
5.

Disadvantages:

1. Learning curve: Implementing dependency injection can require some learning and may be challenging for developers who are not familiar with the pattern.
2. Performance: Dependency injection can add some overhead to the application, which can lead to slower performance.
3. Complexity: Using dependency injection can increase the complexity of the codebase, which may make it harder to understand and maintain.
4. Boilerplate code: Implementing dependency injection can require additional code to be written, which can be tedious and time-consuming.*/
